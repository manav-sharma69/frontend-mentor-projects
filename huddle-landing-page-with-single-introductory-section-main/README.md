## My process
Process was starting with mobile layout first and then moving onto replicating other designs. Then in the end, I tried to make the design fluid by adding various viewport based breakpoints and styling elements within that range.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned about UI styling

### Continued development

Need to practice:
- write shorter code (CSS)
- using CSS units well

### Useful Resources
