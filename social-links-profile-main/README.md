## Overview
To make a Social links profile solution.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- The page should be responsive
- The HTML markup should be semantic and hence accessible (meet the accessibility guidelines given by WCAG)

## My process
I started by analysing the design. Then I wrote appropriate semantic markup, followed by styling. I used mobile-first approach for styling the project responsively. This time I've also tried to use logical CSS properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Here are some things that I learned while working on this challenge:
- writing appropriate semantic markup
- using the accessibility tools in dev tools (the accessibility tree)
- learned about using hrefs (in `<a>` tags) with `"#"` and `"javascript:"` values and what they do and that `"name"` attribute is no longer required
- when to use `<section>` tag and when to use `<article>` tag - they appear somewhat similar
- using the `<address>` tag

### Continued development

Want to keep on improving my markup and styling, do these designing more efficiently.
