## My process
- Doing as much as I can on my own
- Researching for right approach, and applying them!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- learned about the `setProperty()` JS method
- learned how to change SVG's color dynamically
- Learned how to make a UI component - the message box || speech bubble || popup || tooltip (made it the first time, it's a bit hacky, stuggled with it a lot ðŸ˜…)
- made triangle using CSS

### Continued development

- design more new UI components like this one
