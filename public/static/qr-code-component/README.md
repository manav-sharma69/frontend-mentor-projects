## My process

It is a simple card component. So, that's what I did. I just put my image and text (paragraph tag) inside a div and styled it. I set the card's max width to be 320px to meet WCAG guidelines. Typography and color instructions were provided in a styles markdown file.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the WCAG guidelines regarding responsiveness.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about Accessibility.
