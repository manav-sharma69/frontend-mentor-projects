## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**Use *vw* and *vh* to make background images' positioning responsive. Don't use *percentages*.**

### Continued development

Improve CSS markup

### Useful resources

- [background-position (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - The background-position property. Also check other background related properties.
