## My process

- started with HTML
- then wrote CSS
- searching the web the whole time for differernt solutions to the problems I faced

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to create image overlays. The key is to use `inset` property when doing overlays on not the whole page.

### Continued development

Practice more overlaying with CSS as and when needed.

### Useful resources

- [Image overlay example (Codepen.io)](https://codepen.io/ibaslogic/pen/yLEPeXm) - In this example, overlay 5 helped me to complete the challenge. (I got the idea of adding another element and playing with its `position` from Stackoverflow)
- [<figure>: The Figure with Optional Caption element (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure) - Used `<figure>` instead of wrapping everything in `<article>`.
